# Variable Names:
    
"""
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) 
or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). 

Rules for Python variables:
A variable name MUST start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name CANNOT start with a number
A variable name can ONLY contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords

# Legal Variables:
    
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# Illegal Variables:
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"

# Multi Word Variable Names:
    
# Camel Case - Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case - Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

# Snake Case - Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"
